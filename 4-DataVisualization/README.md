Here are some of my "Data Visualization" Projects from freeCodeCamp

## 1. Bar Chart

## 2. Scatterplot Graph
- **Introduction**: In this project I was more familiar with using d3.js so the implementation was easy, notably having to change to "circle"
- **Skills**: D3.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Purposes**: Show the doping in professional bicycle racing - 35 fastest times up Alpe d'Huez

## 3. Heat Map
- **Introduction**: This is the most beautiful project. I really like the color and the way the data is displayed. It's really cool.
- **Skills**: D3.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

## 4. Choropleth Map
- **Introduction**: In this project, the very soft colors created a beautiful chart. And it's quite easy to implement.
- **Skills**: D3.js, topojson, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Purposes**: Show the percentage of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher (2010-2014) in the United States.

## 5. Treemap Diagram
- **Introduction**: This is my final project in this course. I had a lot of trouble making it. But the result is worth it because the data is very rich with 3 different charts.
- **Skills**: D3.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Purposes**: Explore top Kickstarter pledges, video game sales by platform, and highest-grossing movies by genre for trends.
