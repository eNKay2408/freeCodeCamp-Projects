# fcc_Back-End-Development-And-APIs
Here are some of my "Back End Development And APIs" Projects on freeCodeCamp

## 1. Timestamp Microservice
- **Introduction**: This is my first back-end project. I was really excited when I finished, it was really easy and fun, XD.
- **Skills**: NodeJS, Express, API
- **Purposes**: Get unix and utc time from string or current date input.

## 2. Header Parser Microservice

- **Skills**: NodeJS, Express, API, Request Header
- **Purposes**: Get user's IP address, language and user agent.

## 3. URL Shortener Microservice
- **Introduction**: This is a difficult project. A lot of new knowledge was introduced and I had to absorb a lot.

## 4. Exercise Tracker
- **Introduction**: Through this project, I feel like I understand NodeJS better and find it very interesting.

## 5. File Metadata Microservice
