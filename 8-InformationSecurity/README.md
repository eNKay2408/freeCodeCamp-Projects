# fCC_Information-Security
Here are some of my "Information Security" Projects from freeCodeCamp

## 1. Stock Price Checker
- **Introduction**: This is my first security project. I don't think just setting headers to the http response will increase security, it's really simple.
- **Skills**: Express, Helmet, Chai, MongoDB, Bcrypt.
- **Purposes**: Get the stock price from an external API. Allow users to like the stock. Compare the number of likes between two stocks.

## 2. Anonymous Message Board
- **Introduction**: I think this project is more interesting than the first one. I have to implement the authentication and authorization system.
- **Skills**: Express, Helmet, Chai, MongoDB, Bcrypt, Authentication, Authorization.
- **Purposes**: Create a new thread, reply to a thread, report a thread, delete a thread, report a reply, delete a reply.

## 3. Port Scanner
- **Introduction**: This is a simple port scanner. But it took me quite a while to figure out how to validate between IP and host formats.
- **Skills**: Python, Socket, Validation, Unit Test.
- **Purposes**: Scan the ports of a given IP address or host.

## 4. SHA1 Password Cracker
- **Introduction**: This project is easier than the previous one. But it helps me understand how to do brute force attack.
- **Skills**: Python, Hash, Brute Force, Unit Test.
- **Purposes**: Crack some common passwords hashed by SHA1.

## 5. Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game
- **Introduction**: This is the most difficult project I have ever done. I can't complete the project completely, I can only install passing tests
- **Skills**: Express, Socket, Helmet, Chai, Real Time.
- **Purposes**: Create a real-time multiplayer game. Secure the game from cheating. But I can't do it :(
